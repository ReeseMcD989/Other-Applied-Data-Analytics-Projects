    "Clustering is a technique in data analysis that aims to group similar data points together based on their inherent characteristics or patterns. It is an unsupervised learning method that does not rely on predefined labels or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of clustering is to identify natural groupings or clusters within a dataset, where data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other compared to data points in other clusters. Clustering can help uncover underlying structures or relationships in the data, discover patterns, and gain insights into the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of clustering involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess and transform the raw data into a suitable format for clustering. This may involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and selecting relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection/Extraction**: If needed, reduce the dimensionality of the data by selecting important features or extracting new features that capture the essence of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Similarity/Distance Calculation**: Determine the similarity or dissimilarity between data points using appropriate distance metrics. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clustering Algorithm Selection**: Choose an appropriate clustering algorithm based on the nature of the data and the problem at hand. Popular clustering algorithms include k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and Gaussian mixture models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Clustering**: Apply the selected algorithm to partition the data into clusters. Each data point is assigned to a cluster based on its similarity to other data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluation**: Assess the quality of the clustering results. This can be done using internal evaluation metrics such as silhouette score or external evaluation measures if ground truth labels are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Interpretation and Analysis**: Analyze the resulting clusters to understand the patterns and characteristics of each cluster. This may involve visualizing the clusters, examining the cluster centroids or representatives, and conducting further analysis or exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering has various applications in different domains, such as customer segmentation, image segmentation, document clustering, anomaly detection, and recommender systems. It is a valuable tool for exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, and gaining insights from unlabeled data."

    "K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering analysis. It aims to partition a dataset into distinct groups or clusters based on the similarity of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Choose the number of clusters, denoted by \"K,\" that you want to create. Randomly initialize K centroids within the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric, typically the Euclidean distance. This step creates K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the closest centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update**: Recalculate the centroids of the clusters based on the mean (average) of the data points within each cluster. The centroid becomes the new center of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Re-assignment**: Reassign each data point to the nearest centroid based on the updated centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until convergence or until a maximum number of iterations is reached. Convergence occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly, or when the assignments remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Termination**: The algorithm terminates, and the final clusters are determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares, also known as inertia or distortion. The objective is to create clusters that are internally homogeneous (data points within the same cluster are similar) and externally distinct (data points from different clusters are dissimilar).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that K-means clustering requires the number of clusters, K, to be specified in advance. However, determining the optimal value of K can be challenging and may require domain knowledge, heuristics, or evaluation metrics such as the elbow method or silhouette score.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering has various applications, including customer segmentation, image compression, document clustering, anomaly detection, and more. It is a computationally efficient algorithm but can be sensitive to the initial centroid positions and may converge to suboptimal solutions. Therefore, it is common to run the algorithm multiple times with different initializations to mitigate this issue."

    "#### This appendix was authored by Professor John Chandler, Ph.D., of UM, Missoula.\n",
    "\n",
    "A financial institution in Washington has become concerned that their current membership \n",
    "base is not well-aligned with their corporate values. Through that concern they \n",
    "realized that don't actually understand their membership's values very well. They \n",
    "surveyed 2,421 members to shed light on the issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of the survey was the Moral Foundations Theory of Jonathan Haidt. Members \n",
    "were surveyed on the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, which you should take so you \n",
    "understand the test. Survey respondents were scored on the five foundations as well \n",
    "as a single-number summary, Progressivism. \n",
    "\n",
    "The financial institution values Localism, Sustainability, and Education. These aspects \n",
    "of member's values were assessed in the survey as well. Localism and Sustainability used\n",
    "validated scales and thus can be summarized via a single score, where higher values indicate\n",
    "greater support for the values. Education is summarized by the following three questions, \n",
    "which we do not have evidence can be combined into a single score:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In general, public schools provide a better education than private schools.\n",
    "* Public school teachers are underpaid.\n",
    "* Experience is more important than education in determining success in life.\n",
    "These questions were evaluated on a 1 to 6 scale where 1 indicated \"Strongly Disagree\" and \n",
    "6 indicated \"Strongly Agree\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have information on the member that can be used to understand variation \n",
    "in their values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ID: a unique identifier for the survey respondent.\n",
    "* age: the age of the respondent.\n",
    "* gender: gender was evaluated with robust scale and collapsed into male/female/other for \n",
    "  those whose gender identity was not male or female.\n",
    "* engagement: three categories of engagement with the financial institution.\n",
    "* mem.edu: the self-reported education level of the member with the following scale:\n",
    "* zip: the member zip code. \n",
    "* channel: how the member joined the financial institution. Options are \"Loan\" if they joined \n",
    "  via an auto loan, \"Branch\" if they joined at a branch and other for online or unknown. \n",
    "* progressivism/harm/fair/in.group/authority/purity: The MFQ results.\n",
    "* account.age: the age of the member's account, in years. \n",
    "* region: The region of Washington the member lives in. May be easier to work with than zip.\n",
    "* public.sector: has the person ever been a public employee?\n",
    "* sustainability/localism: Scores on the validated scales. Higher values indicate greater\n",
    "  support for the value.\n",
    "* pub.greater.priv/experience.more.important/teachers.underpaid: The responses to the \n",
    "  education questions above. \n",
    "* main.focal.value: Respondents were asked, \"Below is a list of broad areas to which people \n",
    "  often dedicate their volunteer or philanthropic efforts. From this list, please select the \n",
    "  most important to you. If an area of particular importance is missing, please let us know \n",
    "  about it in the space for 'other.'\" This column holds the respondents' answer to that question.\n",
    "* support.of.focal.value: Respondents were given an opportunity to indicate how they \n",
    "  supported their focal value. Those responses were collapsed into a single score, where \n",
    "  a higher value indicates more support.\n"
